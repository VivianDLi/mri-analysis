# MRI Analysis

## Setup

Set up the environment variables by copying the template from `.env.example`, renaming it to `.env`, and filling in the values. The necessary variables are `ROOT_DIR` and `DATA_PATH`, with `BRAIN_PLOTTING_PATH` necessary only if plotting metrics on the brain. This requires the in-house brain plotting script.

## Experiments

All experimental results presented were generated from the models in `mri_analysis/main.py`, with implementations of plots produced in `mri_analysis/visualizations`.

Brain plots were done using an in-house script.
